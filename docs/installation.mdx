You have several options for adding our icons to your project, depending on your preferences and requirements.

# Option 1: Install NPM Package

If you prefer a streamlined approach and want to manage icons as an NPM package, you can use our dedicated NPM package `@josemi-icons/svg`:

<CodeBlock language="shell">
{`## Install via NPM
$ npm install --save @josemi-icons/svg

## OR install via Yarn
$ yarn add @josemi-icons/svg
`}
</CodeBlock>


# Option 2: Download Icons Pack from GitHub Releases

For more flexibility and if you are not using a package manager, you can download the entire icons pack directly from our GitHub releases page. Visit the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jmjuanes/icons/releases) page to find the latest release and download the icons pack.


# Option 3: Download Individual Icons from Website

If you only need specific icons, you can visit our website's icons gallery to browse and download individual icons. Simply click on the icons you need, and you will find download options for each one.
