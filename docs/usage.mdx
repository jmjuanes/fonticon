# Embed Icons within HTML

Our icon collection consists of SVGs, providing you with multiple options for including them in your HTML, depending on your project setup. You can easily obtain the icons by downloading the entire icon pack from the [releases section](https://github.com/jmjuanes/icons/releases), or you can selectively download individual icons from our icons gallery.

## Embedded as SVG element

To embed an icon as an SVG image, simply copy and paste the SVG code of the desired icon directly into your HTML. This allows you to customize the icon's size, color, and other properties as needed, using CSS or inline styles.

<CodeBlock language="html">
{`<html>
<head>
    <title>Icon Usage Example</title>
    <style>
        .icon {
            fill: #ff0000; /* Customize the color */
            width: 24px;   /* Customize the size */
            height: 24px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Using an Icon in HTML</h1>
    <svg class="icon">
        <!-- Paste the SVG code of the icon here -->
    </svg>
</body>
</html>`}
</CodeBlock>

## Referencing as external image

Alternatively, you can reference the icons as normal images using the `<img>` element. Provide the path or URL to the SVG file in the `src` attribute of the `<img>` tag.

<CodeBlock language="html">
{`<html>
<head>
    <title>Icon Usage Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Using an Icon as an External Image</h1>
    <img src="path/to/your/icon.svg" alt="Icon Description" width="24" height="24">
</body>
</html>`}
</CodeBlock>


By employing these embedding techniques, you can seamlessly integrate our icons into your HTML-based projects, enhancing your visual aesthetics and user experience.

Remember, you can download the complete icon pack or select specific icons from our gallery to suit your project's needs. Feel free to customize the icons further to align with your project's unique design requirements.

# Integrating with React

We provide a dedicated NPM package that offers our entire collection of icons as React components, simplifying the process of integrating our icons with your React application.

## Installing React package

You can easily add the package to your project using either Yarn or NPM package managers:

<CodeBlock language="shell">{`$ yarn add @josemi-icons/react`}</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock language="shell">{`$ npm install --save @josemi-icons/react`}</CodeBlock>

## Using React icons components

After successfully installing the package, you can start utilizing icons in your React application just like any other React component:

<CodeBlock language="jsx">
{`import React from "react";
import {ArrowCircleLeftIcon, ArrowCircleRightIcon} from "@josemi-icons/react";

export const App = () => (
    <div className="...">
        <ArrowCircleLeftIcon />
        <ArrowCircleRightIcon />
    </div>
);`}
</CodeBlock>

The example above showcases how to import and use two of our icons, namely `ArrowCircleLeftIcon` and `ArrowCircleRightIcon`. Feel free to explore our extensive icon library and incorporate any relevant icons into your application as needed.

By leveraging our React component-based approach, you can seamlessly integrate our icons within your React project, enabling dynamic and customizable visuals. Customize the icons further by adjusting their size, color, or any other applicable properties based on your project's requirements.
