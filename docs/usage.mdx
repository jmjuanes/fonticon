# Embed Icons within HTML

Our icon collection consists of SVGs, providing you with multiple options for including them in your HTML, depending on your project setup. You can easily obtain the icons by downloading the entire icon pack from the [releases section](https://github.com/jmjuanes/icons/releases), or you can selectively download individual icons from our icons gallery.

## Embedded as SVG element

To embed an icon as an SVG image, simply copy and paste the SVG code of the desired icon directly into your HTML. This allows you to customize the icon's size, color, and other properties as needed, using CSS or inline styles.

<CodeBlock language="html">
{`<html>
<head>
    <title>Icon Usage Example</title>
    <style>
        .icon {
            fill: #ff0000; /* Customize the color */
            width: 24px;   /* Customize the size */
            height: 24px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Using an Icon in HTML</h1>
    <svg class="icon">
        <!-- Paste the SVG code of the icon here -->
    </svg>
</body>
</html>`}
</CodeBlock>

## Referencing as external image

Alternatively, you can reference the icons as normal images using the `<img>` element. Provide the path or URL to the SVG file in the `src` attribute of the `<img>` tag.

<CodeBlock language="html">
{`<html>
<head>
    <title>Icon Usage Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Using an Icon as an External Image</h1>
    <img src="path/to/your/icon.svg" alt="Icon Description" width="24" height="24">
</body>
</html>`}
</CodeBlock>

## Using the SVG Sprite

We provide a convenient SVG sprite as part of the `@josemi-icons/svg` package that includes all the icons in a single file. This approach reduces the number of HTTP requests, improves loading times, and simplifies the management of icons in your project. You can easily reference icons anywhere in your HTML by using the `<svg>` and `<use>` elements.

<CodeBlock language="html">
{`<svg class="icon">
    <use xlink:href="./node_modules/@josemi-icons/svg/sprite.svg#rocket"></use>
</svg>`}
</CodeBlock>

You can apply styles to your icons using CSS, just as you would with any other HTML element. 

<CodeBlock language="css">
{`.icon {
    color: #FF5733; /* Replace with your desired color */
    width: 32px;   /* Set the icon's width */
    height: 32px;  /* Set the icon's height */
}`}
</CodeBlock>
